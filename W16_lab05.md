(a) This project is a connect 4 game. 
    There are two modes: multiplayer PvP, and singleplayer PvAI.

(b) As a player, I can make a move, so that a piece is placed.
    I can undo a move, so that a piece is removed.
    I can exit the game, so that I can either exit the program or
    start a new game.

(c) Yes, the software runs. It does everything listed under "Features" under
    the "Rules" section reachable from the Main Menu.
    It is unclear what Pop Out Mode is meant to do.
    Pop Out Mode does not appear to currently do anything.
    Overall, it behaves as expected, except for some minor known bugs.
    However, there are still many improvements that could be made.

    As a player, I would like a prettier selection menu, so as to improve
    my user experience.
    As a player, I would like to see additional features mid-game, such as: an
    in-game move counter, text that says who's turn it is, and have the game
    show what column the player is about to place the piece in.
    As a player, I would like to see more challenging single-player modes.
    As a player, I would like to see a timed-turn mode, where each player
    has a limited amount of time to make his/her move.

(d) We evaluate the README file as fairly comprehensive. The use of images
    was very helpful in aiding our understanding of the program. The table
    of contents was very helpful as well. Our only complaint is that it does
    not explain what Pop Out Mode does.

(e) Publish and download have already been removed. A few targets: test,
    javadoc, and jar do not have descriptions when ant -p is used. These
    need to be added.

(f) Only two issues are listed. One seems to be related to lag when run
    through ssh. This seems to be expected behavior, so we are not sure why
    this is a bug. We can investigate further to see if there is any way to
    reduce this lag.
  
    The second issue seems to be a minor visual bug with going back to the
    menu after being in a game, which we can also try to fix.

    	 *After re-evaluating the above bug, we have realized that along with
	 displacing the buttons of the main menu, the game does not actually
	 quit. The command line still acts as if the player has not left the
	 game--if you click on a part of the panel that does not have a
	 button, the move-counter changes and a new statement is printed.

    The amount of issues that we can earn points fixing seems to depend on
    what sort of issue is causing the first bug. However, we feel that we
    can earn points by improving other aspects of the game, including adding
    and improving features.

(g) Pop Out Mode does not seem to do anything. In single player mode, along
    with the lag issue already stated in the README, the output in Unix 
    while the game is running, states that the player move "didn't work",
    even though the move worked.
    
(h) After looking at the code in depth, our analysis is that it is very
    intuitive and fairly easy to follow. The comments are extremely helpful
    when the code was hard to understand, and we feel like we have a good
    feel for what previous groups were doing with the code written.

    It is very obvious how the classes are related to one another as each
    class is named according to the code inside of it. Especially after
    running the game and looking at the code, it is easy to see how all
    the classes synthesize and work together.

    If we had to explain the project in the format of a quick summary, we
    would say that the project at hand is to improve a Connect Four
    game made by previous generations of CS56 students.

    Our first goal is to fix the existing problems mentioned in the
    README.md file. We are unsure at the moment what is causing these bugs.

    Our second goal is to improve the user interface to simply look better.
    This can be done by working on the inGameMenuPanel.java file and
    modifying pieces of the code. Then it can be tested by running the
    program from the root directory with ant run.

    Our third goal is to add in-game features. A move counter and turn
    variables and methods modifying them already exist, so it should just be
    a matter of working on the graphics to display them. A piece-preview
    objective can be done with a mouseMotionListener and using graphical
    methods.

    Our fourth goal is to add more difficult AI for single player mode. This
    can be done by using smarter algorithms and more specific cases in the
    singlePlayerAdvanced class in order to analyze the player's moves and
    perform better actions.

    Our fifth goal is to make a timed mode using graphical interfaces and
    a timer for each turn. This could potentially be done by adding a new
    class specifically for timed games.

    Not all of these goals may be feasible to be completed in the time
    allotted for the project, but we will analyze each goal and try our
    best to improve the project as much as possible.
     
    

(i) There are no tests. A test target exists in the build.xml which can be
    used if there were test cases or if test cases were created. There are
    definitely opportunities to expand test coverage, as there is currently
    no test coverage.
