(a) This project is a connect 4 game. 
    There are two modes: multiplayer PvP, and singleplayer PvAI.

(b) As a player, I can make a move, so that a piece is placed.
    I can undo a move, so that a piece is removed.
    I can exit the game, so that I can either exit the program or
    start a new game.

(c) Yes, the software runs. It does everything listed under "Features" under
    the "Rules" section reachable from the Main Menu.
    It is unclear what Pop Out Mode is meant to do.
    Pop Out Mode does not appear to currently do anything.
    Overall, it behaves as expected, except for some minor known bugs.
    However, there are still many improvements that could be made.

    As a player, I would like a prettier selection menu, so as to improve
    my user experience.
    As a programmer, I would like  

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ FINISH C2 

(d) We evaluate the README file as fairly comprehensive. The use of images
    was very helpful in aiding our understanding of the program. The table
    of contents was very helpful as well. Our only complaint is that it does
    not explain what Pop Out Mode does.

(e) Publish and download have already been removed. A few targets: test,
    javadoc, and jar do not have descriptions when ant -p is used. These
    need to be added.

(f) Only two issues are listed. One seems to be related to lag when run
    through ssh. This seems to be expected behavior, so we are not sure why
    this is a bug. We can investigate further to see if there is any way to
    reduce this lag.
  
    The second issue seems to be a minor visual bug, which we can also try
    to fix.

    The amount of issues that we can earn points fixing seems to depend on
    what sort of issue is causing the first bug. However, we feel that we
    can earn points by improving other aspects of the game, including adding
    and improving features.

(g) Pop Out Mode does not seem to do anything. In single player mode, along
    with the lag issue already stated in the README, the output in Unix 
    while the game is running, states that the player move "didn't work",
    even though the move worked.
    
(h)  

(i) There are no tests. A test target exists in the build.xml which can be
    used if there were test cases or if test cases were created. There are
    definitely opportunities to expand test coverage, as there is currently
    no test coverage.
