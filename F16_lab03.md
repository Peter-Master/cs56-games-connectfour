1A) A game of connect-four, where two players stack chips of their own color on a board in an effort to get four of their chips
in a row. The first player to do so wins.


1B) As a player, I can play a single player game with 3 difficulty levels or a multiplayer game of connect four.

1C) The game runs just fine. running the program brings up a title screen and the start button. Pressing start brings up the main menu. From the main menu, I can select 5 choices: Single Player, Multiplayer, Settings, Rules, and Exit. In reverse order, Exit closes the program. Rules brings up a page with the rules of connect four written out, and a button that returns you to the Main Menu. Settings brings up a checkbox that enables "Testing Mode". Testing Mode brings up a button to Print Board during gameplay. There is another button in Settings that takes you back to the Main Menu. Multiplayer brings up a menu with a list of colors to represent the first player. Selecting a color brings up the same menu again, with the color previously selected removed and these colors are to represent the second player. Selecting a color begins the game. An empty board, a 7 x 7 grid with circles in the center, is presented, along with buttons that read Print Board (if testing mode is on), Undo, Restart, Main Menu, and Exit. Clicking a column fills the lowest empty grid in the column with a counter with the current player's color. This continues until a player has four of their counters in a row and wins the game, or all of the grids are full which leads to a draw. Print board does what the button says. Undo undos the last move. Restart clears the board and starts the game again. Main Menu leads back to the main menu, and Exit exits the program. Finally, Single player acts similarly to Multiplayer save a few differences. You must select a difficulty level before you select counters for yourself and the computer opponent. And after you make a move in the game, the computer makes the next move. The difficulty levels do affect the computer's behavior.
