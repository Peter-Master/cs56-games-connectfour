Names: Bryanna Phan and Joel Bagan

##Assessment:
a) A connect four game that allows for multiplayer (human vs human) and singleplayer (human cs computer)

b) As a single player I can, open the rules, choose my dot color and that of the computer, enter my name, choose to play vs an easy AI and an advanced AI. As a player vs player I can, choose my own color, the other player can choose theirs, choose our names, and play the game until we win or draw

c) The software does run, with minor GUI bugs where parts of the screen will disappear until you mouse over it and the advanced AI is a little weak

d)User Stories:
..1. Joel Bagan: Adding in different game modes i.e. Connect 5, power ups, pop-off. Enhance AI.
..2. Bryanna Phan: Adding in a coin flip for who gets first move. Enahnced GUI, maybe add in graphics for coin toss and victory

e)Maybe more detail in the Documentation section on the approach to certain classes, more specifically the SinglePlayer*.java on how the AI makes decisions. In the Features section add that you can edit settings, choose a name and color, access to rules, which are all in the README but scattered around. In How To Run, include information on how to run the program locally on your laptop, if you aren't in CSIL or lab.

f)The javadoc, test, and jar don't have descriptions. No JWS stuff that we can see that needs to be removed.

g)Yes there are enough to earn 1000 points and all of the issues are clear on what the expectations are.

h)Additional Issues:
..1. None for now, will update if we find any
