Lab07 Updates for:

1) Got rid of pop-out mode entirely. Did not understand its purpose and
   thought it was not worth keeping in the project. CN

2) After re-evaluating the bug regarding menu displacement,
   we have realized that along with displacing the buttons of the
   main menu, the game does not actually quit. The command line still
   acts as if the player has not left the game--if you click on a part
   of the panel that does not have a button, the move-counter changes
   and a new statement is printed. CN

       It seems that this issue can be fixed within the mainMenuButtonListener
       class in inGameMenuPanel.java by using the setGameOver method from
       Board.java. Exact implementation is unknown at this point. CN

       After further work and understanding, I believe the bug comes from
       BackToStartScreen() in startScreen2.java. I have not succeeded in
       removing the bug, but I believe I have narrowed it down. CN
    
      Menu displacement still is not fixed but the game continuation problem
      should be fixed now. SZ

3) I tried implementing the whoseTurnTextField in the inGameMenuPanel, but I
   really think it would be easier to make new classes/panels for the
   following:
   A class for the turn counter and to tell you what turn it is.
   A class for the timer.
   More if needed.

   I have started on that with turnPanel.java. CN

   I also made the inGameMenuPanel cyan to see where the panel exactly was
   in the frame. This will be removed. CN

  Christian made a new namePanel class.

  namePanel has been integrated into the player color select screens but
  only works for the first game. After that, the formatting gets messed up
  and it moves to like the western region or something. Winner text now
  displays player name. SZ
