Lab07 Updates for:

1) Got rid of pop-out mode entirely. Did not understand its purpose and
   thought it was not worth keeping in the project.

2) After re-evaluating the bug regarding menu displacement,
   we have realized that along with displacing the buttons of the
   main menu, the game does not actually quit. The command line still
   acts as if the player has not left the game--if you click on a part
   of the panel that does not have a button, the move-counter changes
   and a new statement is printed.
